## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions on [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) to install docker for your machine.

## Prepare the image

Switch to `docker` directory here and run (don't miss the dot at the end of the command!)

```
docker build -t onnx-dev-env .
```

After the build is complete you will have `onnx-dev-env` image that you can use for your work with ONNX in this repository
